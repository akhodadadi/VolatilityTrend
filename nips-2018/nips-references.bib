                   unusually warm or cool seasons, have become more and
                   more “loaded” in the past 30 y, coincident with
                   rapid global warming. The distribution of seasonal
                   mean temperature anomalies has shifted toward higher
                   temperatures and the range of anomalies has
                   increased. An important change is the emergence of a
                   category of summertime extremely hot outliers, more
                   than three standard deviations (3σ) warmer than the
                   climatology of the 1951–1980 base period. This hot
                   extreme, which covered much less than 1\% of
                   Earth’s surface during the base period, now
                   typically covers about 10\% of the land area. It
                   follows that we can state, with a high degree of
                   confidence, that extreme anomalies such as those in
                   Texas and Oklahoma in 2011 and Moscow in 2010 were a
                   consequence of global warming because their
                   likelihood in the absence of global warming was
                   exceedingly small. We discuss practical implications
                   of this substantial, growing, climate change.},

                   year-to-year temperature variability was probably
                   higher in some past cold periods, but there is
                   considerable interest in determining whether global
                   warming is increasing climate variability at present.
                   This interest is motivated by an understanding that
                   increased variability and resulting extreme weather
                   conditions may be more difficult for society to adapt
                   to than altered mean conditions. So far, however, in
                   spite of suggestions of increased variability, there
                   is considerable uncertainty as to whether it is
                   occurring. Here we show that although fluctuations in
                   annual temperature have indeed shown substantial
                   geographical variation over the past few decades, the
                   time-evolving standard deviation of globally averaged
                   temperature anomalies has been stable. A feature of
                   the changes has been a tendency for many regions of
                   low variability to experience increases, which might
                   contribute to the perception of increased climate
                   volatility. The normalization of temperature
                   anomalies creates the impression of larger relative
                   overall increases, but our use of absolute values,
                   which we argue is a more appropriate approach,
                   reveals little change. Regionally, greater
                   year-to-year changes recently occurred in much of
                   North America and Europe. Many climate models predict
                   that total variability will ultimately decrease under
                   high greenhouse gas concentrations, possibly
                   associated with reductions in sea-ice cover. Our
                   findings contradict the view that a warming world
                   will automatically be one of more overall climatic
                   variation.},

                   observations from September 1957 to August 2002
                   produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range
                   Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in collaboration with many
                   institutions. The observing system changed
                   considerably over this re-analysis period, with
                   assimilable data provided by a succession of
                   satellite-borne instruments from the 1970s onwards,
                   supplemented by increasing numbers of observations
                   from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other surface
                   platforms, but with a declining number of radiosonde
                   ascents since the late 1980s. The observations used
                   in ERA-40 were accumulated from many sources. The
                   first part of this paper describes the data
                   acquisition and the principal changes in data type
                   and coverage over the period. It also describes the
                   data assimilation system used for ERA-40. This
                   benefited from many of the changes introduced into
                   operational forecasting since the mid-1990s, when the
                   systems used for the 15-year ECMWF re-analysis
                   (ERA-15) and the National Centers for Environmental
                   Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research
                   (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis were implemented. Several of
                   the improvements are discussed. General aspects of
                   the production of the analyses are also summarized. A
                   number of results indicative of the overall
                   performance of the data assimilation system, and
                   implicitly of the observing system, are presented and
                   discussed. The comparison of background (short-range)
                   forecasts and analyses with observations, the
                   consistency of the global mass budget, the magnitude
                   of differences between analysis and background fields
                   and the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from
                   the ERA-40 analyses are illustrated. Several results
                   demonstrate the marked improvement that was made to
                   the observing system for the southern hemisphere in
                   the 1970s, particularly towards the end of the
                   decade. In contrast, the synoptic quality of the
                   analysis for the northern hemisphere is sufficient to
                   provide forecasts that remain skilful well into the
                   medium range for all years. Two particular problems
                   are also examined: excessive precipitation over
                   tropical oceans and a too strong Brewer-Dobson
                   circulation, both of which are pronounced in later
                   years. Several other aspects of the quality of the
                   re-analyses revealed by monitoring and validation
                   studies are summarized. Expectations that the
                   ‘second-generation’ ERA-40 re-analysis would
                   provide products that are better than those from the
                   firstgeneration ERA-15 and NCEP/NCAR re-analyses are
                   found to have been met in most cases. © Royal

                   much of climate change research in ecology has
                   focused on the impacts of mean temperature change.
                   Here, we couple fine-grained climate projections
                   (2050{\textendash}2059) to thermal performance data
                   from 38 ectothermic invertebrate species and contrast

                   changes to the variation, and to the mean and
                   variation in concert. Although most species show
                   increases in performance at greater mean
                   temperatures, the effect of mean and variance change
                   together yields a range of responses, with temperate
                   species at greatest risk of performance declines. Our

                   record derived from NOAA polar-orbiting weather
                   satellites using cloud properties retrieved from the
                   Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and
                   spectral brightness temperatures (Tb) observed by the
                   High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS).
                   The authors seek to produce a seamless, global-scale,
                   long-term record of cloud type and Tb statistics
                   intended to better characterize clouds from seasonal
                   to decadal time scales. Herein, the methodology is
                   described in which the cloud type statistics
                   retrieved from AVHRR are interpolated onto each HIRS
                   footprint using two cloud classification methods.
                   This approach is tested over the northeast tropical
                   and subtropical Pacific Ocean region, which contains
                   a wide variety of cloud types during a significant
                   ENSO variation from 2008 to 2009. It is shown that
                   the Tb histograms sorted by cloud type are realistic
                   for all HIRS channels. The magnitude of Tb biases
                   among spatially coincident satellite intersections
                   over the northeast Pacific is a function of cloud
                   type and wavelength. While the sign of the bias can
                   change, the magnitudes are generally small for
                   NOAA-18 and NOAA-19, and NOAA-19 and MetOp-A
                   intersections. The authors further show that the
                   differences between calculated standard deviations of
                   cloud-typed Tb well exceed intersatellite calibration
                   uncertainties. The authors argue that consideration
                   of higher-order statistical moments determined from
                   spectral infrared observations may serve as a useful
                   long-term measure of small-scale spatial changes, in
                   particular cloud types over the HIRS--AVHRR observing

                   important to be able to solve problems with a very
                   large number of features or training examples. As a

                   solution methods are either necessary or at least

                   suited to distributed convex optimization, and in
                   particular to large-scale problems arising in
                   statistics, machine learning, and related areas. The
                   method was developed in the 1970s, with roots in the
                   1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to many
